    <h1>Twitter Clone SRS</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Twitter clone is a web-based application that allows users to post short messages (tweets) and follow other users. This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the application.</p>

    <h2>Product Scope</h2>
    <p>The Twitter clone will be a simple and easy-to-use web-based application that allows users to post tweets and follow other users. The application will have a login/signup page, user profile pages, a home page, and features such as liking tweets and searching for other users or tweets. The application will be accessible via a web browser and will be designed to be responsive and work on different devices and screen sizes.</p>

    <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>User Registration: The system shall allow users to create an account by entering their name, email address, and password.</li>
      <li>User Login: The system shall allow users to log in to their account using their email address and password.</li>
      <li>Tweeting: The system shall allow users to post tweets up to 280 characters long.</li>
      <li>Viewing Tweets: The system shall allow users to view their own tweets and the tweets of other users they are following on the home page.</li>
      <li>Following: The system shall allow users to follow and unfollow other users.</li>
      <li>Searching: The system shall allow users to search for other users or tweets using keywords.</li>
      <li>Liking: The system shall allow users to like tweets.</li>
      <li>Notifications: The system shall notify users when someone likes their tweet, follows them, or mentions them in a tweet.</li>
      <li>User Logout: The system shall allow users to log out of the application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Performance: The system shall be fast and efficient, even with a large number of users and tweets.</li>
      <li>Security: The system shall be secure and protect user data and accounts.</li>
      <li>Usability: The system shall be easy to use and navigate.</li>
      <li>Scalability: The system shall be scalable and able to handle increased traffic and usage.</li>
      <li>Compatibility: The system shall be compatible with different web browsers and operating systems.</li>
      <li>Reliability: The system shall be reliable and available for use at all times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>The Twitter clone will use a client-server architecture. The frontend will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and will communicate with the backend server using HTTP requests. The backend server will be built using a server-side programming language such as Python or Node.js, and will use a database to store and retrieve user data and tweets.</p>

    <h2>User Interface Design</h2>
<p>The user interface will be designed to be simple and easy to use. The login/signup page will have a form for users to enter their credentials or create a new account. The user profile page will display the user's tweets, followers and following lists. The home page will display the user's timeline and allow them to post new tweets.</p>
<p>The user interface will also include the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Navigation Bar: The navigation bar will be present on all pages and will allow users to access different parts of the application such as the home page, user profile page, and search page.</li>
  <li>Like Button: The like button will be present on each tweet and will allow users to like a tweet.</li>
  <li>Search Bar: The search bar will be present on the home page and user profile page and will allow users to search for other users or tweets.</li>
  <li>Notifications: The notifications will be displayed in a dropdown menu accessible from the navigation bar and will show when someone likes the user's tweet, follows them, or mentions them in a tweet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>System Constraints</h2>
<p>The Twitter clone will be a web-based application and will require an internet connection to function. The application will be designed to work on different devices and screen sizes, but there may be limitations for older devices or web browsers. The application will also have the following system constraints:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Server Requirements: The server will need to meet the minimum requirements for the server-side programming language and database being used.</li>
  <li>Database Constraints: The database will need to be able to handle a large number of users and tweets and have efficient indexing and querying capabilities.</li>
  <li>Security Constraints: The application will need to follow best practices for securing user data and preventing unauthorized access or attacks.</li>
</ul>
